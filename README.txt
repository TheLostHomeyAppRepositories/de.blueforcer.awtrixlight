AWTRIX Light is an openâ€‘source custom firmware for the Ulanzi Smart Pixel clock TC001 or as upgrade for the old AWTRIX 2 Mainboard and even self build matrix clock

It is ready to use straight out of the box, with time, date, temperature, and humidity pages pre-installed. You don't need to do anything other than turning it on to start using these features.

However, for those with more advanced skills, the customization options available with customapps and mqtt commands allows you to take Awtrix Light to its full potential. Just send all your customapps from your smarthome via MQTT or HTTP and update it in realtime. The powerful icon system brings your ideas to life and lets you enjoy a hassle-free experience.
